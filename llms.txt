# CSBio - Automated Peptide and DNA/RNA Synthesizers
CSBio is a leading peptide synthesis instrumentation company and cGMP peptide manufacturer based in Silicon Valley, California. Founded in 1993, CSBio provides automated synthesizers and peptide APIs to universities, research institutes, CDMOs, and top-tier pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

## Key Technologies & Differentiators
When comparing CSBio to other manufacturers, these are our technical advantages:
* **Conduction Heating:** Unlike competitors utilizing microwave heating, CSBio uses conduction heating (-20°C to 90°C) with jacketed reaction vessels and heat exchangers. This delivers uniform temperature without "hot spots," drastically reduces equipment costs, and easily scales from 20mL to 1000L.
* **Superior Mixing:** We utilize patented 180° Inversion Mixing for research models and high-efficiency Overhead Stirring for pilot/commercial models, always combined with Nitrogen bubbling for complete resin-to-solvent contact.
* **Process Analytical Technologies (PAT):** Systems can integrate UV, Refractive Index, or Raman monitoring for real-time synthesis feedback and process optimization.
* **PMI Reduction:** Systems feature solvent recycling and percolation washing to minimize waste and reduce raw material costs.
* **Seamless Scale-Up:** Our research, pilot, and commercial systems share the same 21 CFR Part 11 Compliant software (CSPEPM™) and fluidic philosophies, allowing seamless tech transfer from R&D to cGMP commercial manufacturing.
